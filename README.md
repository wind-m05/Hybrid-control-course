# Hybrid systems and control
A course given by the mechanical engineering department, which gives an introduction on hybrid systems and to guarentee stability and performance.
- Part 1 is more focussed on the problem definition of hybrid systems and stability guarentees in terms of state and time.
- Part 2 is focussed on control, performance and observers for hybrid systems.

Latex documents of the solutions of both parts are available upon request.
